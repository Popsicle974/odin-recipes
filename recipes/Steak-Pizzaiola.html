    <h1><strong>The Most Amazing Steak Pizzaiola!</strong></h1>
    <a><img src="../recipes/images/steak-pizzaiola.webp" alt=""></a>
    <p>There are hundreds of ways to make steak pizzaiola, from versions featuring slowly braised tough cuts of beef to quickly seared tenderloin medallions, like I used here. 
        The one thing most people agree on is that you should use really fresh, very sweet, vine-ripened tomatoes. 
        Serve on top of toasted bread with mozzarella cheese.</p>

        <h3> <strong> Ingredients</strong> </h3>
    
         <ul><li>1 pound beef tenderloin steaks, cut into 4 medallions</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
            <li> 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced sweet and hot peppers</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>½ cup white wine</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato concassé (see Recipe Tip for the recipe link)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            

        </ul>
        <h3> <strong> Directions</strong></h3>
        <ol><li>Season steak medallions with salt and black pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add steaks and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. 
                Transfer to a plate. Reserve oil in skillet.</li>
            <li>Place mushrooms and butter into the skillet and season with salt; 
                cook and stir until mushrooms are softened and beginning to brown, 5 to 6 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to medium; add peppers and cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. 
                Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Pour in wine and sprinkle in dried oregano. 
                Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the wine is nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir tomato concassé into the mushroom mixture and simmer until tomato is softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
                Add fresh oregano, balsamic vinegar, and red pepper flakes; stir to combine. 
                Adjust salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Place steaks back into the skillet with the mushroom mixture 
                and cook until warmed through and cooked to desired doneness, 4 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li></ol>
